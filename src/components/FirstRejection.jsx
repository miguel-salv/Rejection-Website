            <h1>Your First Rejection: It's Okay to Feel Disappointed</h1>
            <p>
              Getting your first job rejection can be particularly tough. It's completely normal to feel disappointed, frustrated, or even question your capabilities. These feelings are valid and shared by many students at this stage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember that a rejection is not a reflection of your worth or potential. It's simply one step in your professional journey, and every successful person has faced similar challenges.

          <strong>Rejection Sensitivity</strong>
          <p>
            Rejection Sensitivity is a learned disposition where individuals anxiously expect rejection when going into a job application setting, increasing the chance of rejection.<sup>1</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            This heightened sensitivity can lead to increased stress levels, reduced self-confidence, and a tendency to withdraw from future job opportunities.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li style={{ '--li-index': 5 }}>
          <strong>Develop Resilience</strong>
          <p>
            Job searching is often more intense at lower rungs at the ladder.<sup>2</sup> Remember that rejection is a normal part of the professional journey and doesn't define your worth or potential.
          </p>
          <p>
            Focus on the learning opportunities each application process provides, using them to build confidence and experience.

        <li style={{ '--li-index': 6 }}>
          <strong>Keep Moving Forward</strong>

            Continue to explore new opportunities while maintaining a positive outlook. Each application is a fresh start.
